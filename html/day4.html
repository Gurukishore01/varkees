    <p>Zenitsu Agatsuma is one of the main characters in the anime and manga series Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba.
          He's a Demon Slayer who initially appears cowardly and anxious, often doubting his own abilities.
          Despite his fearfulness, Zenitsu possesses incredible potential, 
          especially when unconscious or in extreme fear—entering a state of calm where he showcases lightning-fast reflexes and immense power. 
          He specializes in Thunder Breathing, and his signature move, First Form: Thunderclap and Flash, is both powerful and visually striking. 
          Zenitsu also brings a mix of comic relief and emotional depth to the story, especially through his devotion to his friends and his love-struck antics</p>

         <p id="para-2">Nezuko Kamado is a main character in Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. 
            After her family is killed by demons, she’s turned into a demon herself—but unlike others, she retains her humanity and refuses to harm humans. 
            She has powerful abilities like regeneration, super strength, and sunlight resistance, and fights alongside her brother Tanjiro, who seeks a cure for her. 
            Despite being a demon, Nezuko is kind, loyal, and fiercely protective of those she loves.</p>
         <p class="para-1">Tanjiro Kamado is the main protagonist of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. He is kind, empathetic, and determined, with a strong sense of justice. 
            After his family is slaughtered by demons and his sister Nezuko is turned into one, he becomes a Demon Slayer to avenge them and find a cure for Nezuko.
           Tanjiro wields a Nichirin Sword, learns Water Breathing and later Sun Breathing, and is known for his sharp sense of smell and unwavering compassion—even for his enemies. 
           His journey is driven by love, resilience, and the desire to protect others.
